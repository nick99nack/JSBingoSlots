   JSBingoSlots - Game Play:
  </H1>
  <P>
   The object of JSBingoSlots is to accumulate the highest number of points by covering all the numbers.  A game ends when the card is <B>filled</B> or after <B>20</B> <I>spins</I>.
  </P>
  <P>
	At the start of a JSBingoSlots game you are given a card with 25 numbers (five columns of five numbers).  Under the card are five wheels corresponding to each of the five columns of numbers.  Each spin generates a unique set of numbers and game icons in the five wheels.
  </P>
  <P>
	On each spin, you match your numbers and Jokers appearing in the wheels by clicking on a number in the corresponding column above.  A correct match covers the number.  The wheels also display game icons (<FONT Color="red">Gold Coin</FONT>, <FONT Color="red">Free Spin</FONT>, and the <FONT Color="red">Devil</FONT>).
  </P>
  <P>
	During spins 17-20 you must buy each spin using your points or an accumulated Free Spin.  If you do not have enough points or Free Spins to use,  the game <B>will end</B>.
  </P>
  <H2>SCORING:</H2>
  <UL type="square">
	<LI>Each <FONT Color="red">Covered Number</FONT> earns <B>200</B> points.
	<LI>A <FONT Color="red">Joker</FONT> allows you to <B>click</B> on only <B>one uncovered number</B> in the corresponding column above that Joker.  Each number covered using a Joker earns <I>200</I> points.
	<LI>A <FONT Color="red">Gold Coin</FONT> awards <B>1000</B> points to your score.
	<LI>A <FONT Color="red">Devil</FONT> <B>deducts one-half</B> of the <B>points</B> from your score.  After the Devil takes your points you can still continue to earn points and/or Free Spins.
	<LI><FONT Color="red">The Angel</FONT> randomly appears to <B>chase</B> the <B>Devil</B> <I>before he has an opportunity to take half your points.</I> Remember, when the Cherub appears <B>your points are protected</B> only for that spin.
	<LI>A <FONT Color="red">Free Spin</FONT> is automatically <B>saved for use during spins 17 - 20</B> to buy a spin.  You can accumulate a maximum of <I>four</I> Free Spins in a game.
	<LI>A <FONT Color="red">Bingo</FONT> occurs when <B>five successive numbers</B> are <B>covered</B> either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is possible to get <I>multiple</I> Bingos during any spin. There are 12 possible Bingos, and each Bingo earns 1,000 points.
